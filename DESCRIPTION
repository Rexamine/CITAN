Title: CITation ANalysis toolpack
Description: CITAN package for (among others) quantitative
    research in scientometrics and bibliometrics. It
    contains various tools for preprocessing bibliographic
    data retrieved e.g. from Elsevier's SciVerse Scopus and
    calculating bibliometric impact of individuals.
    Additionaly, some functions dealing with Pareto-Type II
    (GPD) and Discretized Pareto-Type II statistical models
    are included (e.g. Zhang-Stephens and MLE estimators,
    goodness-of-fit and two-sample tests, confidence
    intervals for the theoretical Hirsch index etc.). They
    may be used to describe and analyze many phenomena
    encountered in the social sciences.
